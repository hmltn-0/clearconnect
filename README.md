# clearconnect

The universal internet.

This is a very, very early stage start-up concept. The developer, Julius Hamilton, studied linguistics, mathematics, and computer science at the University of California and several universities in Sweden. He has several years of experience in applied linguistics and computational linguistics as a private consultant and contractor. Since 2021 he has been studying more advanced mathematics, data science, and software engineering. I have been loosely affiliated with the AI Agent startup Cognosys and the data science company Conexus. I have also contributed to open source Python libraries like Trafilatura and participated in hackathons. This is my first software project. I am looking for funding. Contact: juliushamilton100@gmail.com. Thanks.

# Everybody has an armory of wirelessly-enabled devices.

These devices are capable of bidirectional communication. The main reason we are not using them that way is because the companies who own those devices do not want you to not need them anymore. There is ample evidence of companies like AT&T and Apple pursuing business strategies that create *artificial dependence*: you can't repair your Mac; you can't install software they don't want you to; you couldn't use your phone as a hotspot until AT&T finally agreed; you can't switch your phone to another carrier if it's locked; et cetera.

The other main reason is because it's a tough engineering challenge. Many people are working on the emerging new field of decentralized mobile mesh networks. It's a promising field. It's just that nobody has solved the problem yet, by creating an infrastructure and a protocol with wide adoption. We at clearconnect just want to join in and try to develop a frontier technology that could change the internet as we know it.

# How it would work.

1. You have a wirelessly enabled hardware device (a smartwatch, laptop, smartphone, WiFi router, etc.)
2. You install our software or firmware that allows it to engage in the network as a node (like a vast array of other decentralized blockchain protocols.)
3. Your device acts as a relay, passing internet messages onwards to other nodes.
4. You get paid for the bandwidth and energy you provide to the network.
5. You either pay to use the network, or the network is free and has some other profit-model. **TBD.**

# About

## Executive summary:

ClearConnect LLC is a start-up that develops a decentralized, open-source networking protocol called clearconnect. Any device with certain minimum requirements of computing and networking capabilities can participate in the network as a node.  A node acts like a router, routing traffic to various locations. To incentivize contributors of compute and bandwidth, the protocol uses a proof-of-work algorithm, like Bitcoin.

## Customer Problem

The internet is controlled by big companies. That means that individuals have limited freedom or control in modifying something about the internet when they want to. They cannot determine how much it should cost, what it should be like to sign up, and where you can and cannot access the internet. It doesn't have to be this way.

## Target Market

Every human on Earth.

## Customer Segments

To gain traction we will promote the project in communities where it would find appeal. We would emphasize its usefulness from the beginning: that there is a usable and cheap if not free alternative internet. We will find marketable applications to onboard less technology-oriented consumers by emphasizing that clearconnect is a universal network, not a product you buy from a company like Google Fiber. You just tap into the network and you're free
