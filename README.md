The universal internet.

This is a very, very early stage start-up concept. The developer, Julius Hamilton, studied linguistics, mathematics, and computer science at the University of California and several universities in Sweden. He has several years of experience in applied linguistics and computational linguistics as a private consultant and contractor. Since 2021 he has been studying more advanced mathematics, data science, and software engineering. I have been loosely affiliated with the AI Agent startup Cognosys and the data science company Conexus. I have also contributed to open source Python libraries like Trafilatura and participated in hackathons. This is my first software project. I am looking for funding.

# Everybody has an armory of wirelessly-enabled devices.

These devices are capable of bidirectional communication. The main reason we are not using them that way is because the companies who own those devices do not want you to not need them anymore. There is ample evidence of companies like AT&T and Apple pursuing business strategies that create *artificial dependence*: you can't repair your Mac; you can't install software they don't want you to; you couldn't use your phone as a hotspot until AT&T finally agreed; you can't switch your phone to another carrier if it's locked; et cetera.

The other main reason is because it's a tough engineering challenge. Many people are working on the emerging new field of decentralized mobile mesh networks. It's a promising field. It's just that nobody has solved the problem yet, by creating an infrastructure and a protocol with wide adoption. We at clearconnect just want to join in and try to develop a frontier technology that could change the internet as we know it.

# How it would work

1. You have a wirelessly enabled hardware device (a smartwatch, laptop, smartphone, WiFi router, etc.)
2. You install our software or firmware that allows it to engage in the network as a node (like a vast array of other decentralized blockchain protocols.)
3. Your device acts as a relay, passing internet messages onwards to other nodes.
4. You get paid for the bandwidth and energy you provide to the network.
5. You either pay to use the network, or the network is free and has some other profit-model. **TBD.**
